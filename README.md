   I just found these files when digging through old stuff on my computer!

   I first discovered programming (also in Python) when I was around 13 or 14 in 2010/11, but it got a little difficult for me at the time. 
   Unfortunately, I can't find any of those projects. From what I can remember, they were all pretty simple. 

   The programs in this repo are from the second time I discovered programming, and this time, I loved it! These are the first projects that I did which had some sort of weight to them. They are all made for Python 2.
   Coming across these five years later gives me a strange sense of nostalgia because I can see how far I've come :) 

   From what I can tell, some seem unfinished, but the majority is complete.
   Regardless, I pushing the entire folder completely unedited so they can stay in the form I found them. This way I can come back in another five years and see how much further I have come still.
